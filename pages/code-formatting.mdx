# Code Formatting

Toga is written in Go and uses the default Go formatter. This ensures that all code adheres to a consistent style, making it easier to read and maintain. Here is an example of Go code formatted using the default Go formatter:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

The Go formatter automatically handles indentation, spacing, and other formatting details, allowing developers to focus on writing clean and efficient code.
